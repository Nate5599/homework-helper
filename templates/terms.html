  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: September 28, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>Homework Helper</strong> (the “Service”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding agreement between you and the operator of Homework Helper (“we,” “us,” or “our”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

  <h2>1) Eligibility; Accounts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must be at least 13 years old. If you are between 13–17, you represent you have permission from a parent/guardian.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for all activity under your account.</li>
    <li>We may refuse, suspend, or terminate accounts at our discretion for any violation of these Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Educational-Only; No Professional Advice</h2>
  <p>The Service is for educational, study-aid, and demonstrative purposes only. It does not provide professional, medical, legal, financial, or other regulated advice. You understand and agree you use outputs at your own risk and must verify accuracy independently.</p>

  <h2>3) Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree you will not, and will not permit others to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the Service to violate any law or infringe any right, including copyright, privacy, or publicity rights.</li>
    <li>Upload malicious code, attempt to access non-public areas, or interfere with the Service’s operation.</li>
    <li>Decompile, reverse engineer, or attempt to derive source code (except as permitted by applicable law).</li>
    <li>Submit personal data of others without their permission or any sensitive data not necessary for educational use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) User Content & License</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>“User Content” means content you input, upload, or generate using the Service.</li>
    <li>You retain ownership of your User Content. You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to store and process your User Content solely to provide and improve the Service.</li>
    <li>You represent you have necessary rights to submit User Content and it does not violate laws or third-party rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Local Operation; Safe Mode</h2>
  <p>The Service can operate locally and may run in a “safe mode” that does not call external AI services. When safe mode is enabled, no User Content is transmitted to third-party AI providers. If you later enable any third-party integrations, additional terms may apply (see Privacy Policy).</p>

  <h2>6) Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>We and our licensors own all rights in the Service, including software, UI, and trademarks. Except for your limited right to use the Service under these Terms, no rights are granted.</p>

  <h2>7) Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Service may include optional sign-in or integrations (e.g., Google/Microsoft/GitHub). Your use of any third-party service is governed by that third party’s terms. We are not responsible for third-party services.</p>

  <h2>8) Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED.</p>

  <h2>9) Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (US$100) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO USE THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM (IF ANY).</p>

  <h2>10) Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your User Content or your violation of these Terms.</p>

  <h2>11) Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access immediately if you violate these Terms. You may stop using the Service at any time. Upon termination, your rights immediately cease. Sections that by their nature should survive, do survive (e.g., ownership, disclaimers, limitations, indemnity, dispute resolution).</p>

  <h2>12) Dispute Resolution; Arbitration; Class-Action Waiver</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Governing Law: These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of law.</li>
    <li>Arbitration: Any dispute arising from or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be finally resolved by <strong>binding individual arbitration</strong> administered by JAMS under its rules. The arbitration will be held in New York County, New York, in English. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.</li>
    <li>Class Waiver: You and we agree that each may bring claims only in an individual capacity, not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</li>
    <li>Injunctive Relief: Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in court to protect intellectual property or confidential information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>13) Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms by posting a revised version with a new “Last updated” date. Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
