  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: September 28, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Homework Helper</strong> (“we,” “us,” “our”) collects, uses, and protects information in connection with the Service.</p>

  <h2>1) What We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> username, password (stored locally as provided), optional email and/or phone number.</li>
    <li><strong>Study Data:</strong> content you submit (e.g., questions, flashcards, planner items) stored locally in JSON files for your account.</li>
    <li><strong>Device/Usage:</strong> minimal technical logs necessary to operate locally (e.g., timestamps). No ad tracking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Service’s core features (login, study tools, history).</li>
    <li>Operate in “safe mode” by default so study content does <em>not</em> leave your device unless you enable an external integration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Local-Only by Default</h2>
  <p>By default, data is stored locally on your machine in simple JSON files for demonstration and educational purposes. If you delete the app folder, the local data is removed. We do not sell your data. We do not run third-party ads.</p>

  <h2>4) Third-Party Sign-In (Optional)</h2>
  <p>If you choose Google, Microsoft, or GitHub to sign in, the respective provider may share basic profile information (e.g., name, email) per their privacy policies. We store only what is necessary to create and access your account. You should review the provider’s privacy policy before using it.</p>

  <h2>5) No Sale; No Targeted Advertising</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal information. We do not use targeted advertising.</p>

  <h2>6) Cookies & Local Storage</h2>
  <p>The Service may use browser cookies or localStorage solely for session management and remembering UI preferences (e.g., last open tab). No third-party tracking cookies are used.</p>

  <h2>7) Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Service is intended for users 13+ with parental permission where required. If you are under 13, do not use the Service. If we learn a user under 13 has provided personal information, we will delete it when feasible.</p>

  <h2>8) Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures appropriate for a local demo. However, no system is 100% secure. You are responsible for safeguarding your device and account credentials.</p>

  <h2>9) Your Choices & Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access/Update:</strong> You may update your display name and avatar in onboarding/settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Delete the app folder to remove locally stored data. If you used a third-party sign-in, change or revoke access from that provider’s account settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10) International Users</h2>
  <p>The Service is operated in the United States. If you access from other regions, you consent to data processing in the U.S. according to this Policy.</p>

  <h2>11) Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy by posting a revised version with a new “Last updated” date. Your continued use constitutes acceptance.</p>
